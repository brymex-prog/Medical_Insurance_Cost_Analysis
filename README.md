# Medical Insurance Cost Analysis & Data Storytelling

This project explores a large-scale medical insurance dataset to understand the key factors driving annual healthcare costs. Using Python-based exploratory data analysis and statistical techniques, the analysis focuses on uncovering cost patterns related to age, BMI, smoking behaviour, chronic disease burden, and socioeconomic factors, while demonstrating effective data storytelling practices.

The project also highlights the importance of data preprocessing and transformation, particularly when dealing with skewed financial data.

## Dataset Description
Size: 100,000 rows × 54 columns

#### Key Features:

Demographics: Age, Sex, Region

Socioeconomic: Income, Education, Employment

Health Indicators: BMI, Blood Pressure, Chronic Disease Burden

Insurance Outcomes: Annual Medical Cost, Claims Count

## Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib

Jupyter Notebook

## Analysis Approach

Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values and categorical data)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand distributions and relationships

Identification of skewness in annual medical costs

Application of log transformation to stabilise variance and improve interpretability

Feature grouping using age categories and BMI categories

Visual analysis using box plots, scatter plots, and regression plots


 ## Key Insights

Annual medical costs are highly right-skewed, requiring transformation for meaningful analysis.

Age, BMI, and chronic disease burden are strong drivers of increased healthcare costs.

Smokers incur significantly higher medical expenses compared to non-smokers.

Risk scores show a positive relationship with claims count, indicating higher utilisation.


## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how thoughtful preprocessing, statistical analysis, and visual storytelling can transform complex healthcare data into clear, actionable insights. It also highlights the importance of presenting analytical findings in a way that is accessible to non-technical audiences.
